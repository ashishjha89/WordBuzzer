# WordBuzzer
Small multiplayer language game for one device

- The game screen contains button in each corners of the screen - one for each possible player.

- There will be a word in language "one“ in the middle of the screen.
While this word is displayed, a word in language "two“ will fade in from left (or right) border (alternatively) of the screen, 
move over the screen and then fade out again within 2 seconds. After one word is faded out, a new word is faded in (from opposite direction).
